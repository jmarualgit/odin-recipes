Following the [Odin Project's course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) on web development, this is [the first mini project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#introduction) I have and it is to make a basic recipe website.

Coded purely in HTML.
